# Troubleshooting and Common Pitfalls

Discover practical solutions to frequent issues users face when working with Dessine-moi's Factory. This guide focuses on diagnosing problems related to missing types, misconfigured dictionary inputs, and type resolution errors. We'll provide actionable debugging methods and best practices to ensure smooth, error-free dynamic object creation.

## 1. Understanding Common Error Scenarios

Dessine-moi’s dynamic object factory relies on precise type registration and correctly structured inputs. Errors typically stem from:

- Missing or unregistered type IDs
- Improper dictionary structures (especially the missing or incorrect `type` key)
- Conflicts or mistakes with aliases and lazy type resolution
- Mismatched or restrictive type constraints during object creation

Being aware of these pitfalls helps you diagnose and fix issues swiftly.

## 2. Troubleshooting Workflow Overview

### Prerequisites

- Confirm that your Python environment meets the minimum requirement (Python 3.8+).
- Verify you have installed Dessine-moi correctly (see [Installation Guide](https://dessinemoi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/setup/installation.html)).
- Ensure your Factory instance has been properly initialized and your types registered.

### Step-by-Step Diagnostic Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify Type Registration">
Check your Factory’s registry to confirm that all required types are correctly registered with unique type IDs.

Example:
```python
print(factory.registry.keys())  # Should include your expected type strings
```

If a type is missing, register it before attempting creation or conversion:

```python
factory.register(YourClass, type_id='your_type')
```

This avoids **ValueError** when converting dictionaries or creating instances.
</Step>

<Step title="Check Dictionary Input Structure">
Ensure dictionaries passed to the factory include a proper `type` key specifying a registered type ID.

Example of valid input:

```python
{
    "type": "sheep",
    "wool": "thick"
}
```

Missing or incorrect `type` keys cause conversion failures:

```python
factory.convert({"wool": "thick"})  # Raises ValueError
```

Always validate dictionary keys before conversion.
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm Allowed Type Constraints">
If you use the `allowed_cls` parameter in `create` or `convert` to restrict types, verify your input types comply.

Attempting to create or convert with an unallowed type will throw a **TypeError**:

```python
factory.create("sheep", allowed_cls=Lamb)  # Raises TypeError if 'sheep' not subtype of Lamb
```

Review your allowed type constraints to ensure they match your design intent.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Aliases and Lazy Types">
If you registered aliases, confirm they correctly point to existing registered types.

Incorrect aliasing triggers registration errors.

For lazy types registered as strings (e.g., module paths), confirm that:

- The import path is valid and reachable.
- The lazy type is resolved upon creation, updating the registry.

Test lazy resolution by creating an instance and inspecting the registry entry afterward.
</Step>

<Step title="Review Registered Dict Constructors">
If you use `dict_constructor` for custom class method initialization, verify the method name is correct and accessible.

An incorrect `dict_constructor` causes ValueError during registration or conversion.

Example:

```python
factory.register(YourClass, type_id="your_type", dict_constructor="from_dict")
```

Ensure `YourClass.from_dict` exists and matches expected signature.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Practical Debugging Examples

### Example 1: Missing Type Registration

```python
from dessinemoi import Factory
factory = Factory()

try:
    obj = factory.convert({"type": "unknown"})
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
# Output: Error: Type ID 'unknown' is not registered.
```

**Fix:** Register the type before converting.

### Example 2: Dictionary Missing `type` Key

```python
input_dict = {"name": "Dolly", "age": 5}
try:
    obj = factory.convert(input_dict)
except KeyError as e:
    print(f"Missing key: {e}")
```

**Fix:** Include a `type` key in your dictionary to specify the object type.

### Example 3: Incompatible Allowed Type

```python
class Sheep:
    pass

class Lamb(Sheep):
    pass

factory.register(Sheep, type_id='sheep')
factory.register(Lamb, type_id='lamb')

try:
    factory.create('sheep', allowed_cls=Lamb)
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)  # 'sheep' does not reference allowed type <class 'Lamb'>
```

**Fix:** Remove or adjust your `allowed_cls` constraint.

## 4. Best Practices to Avoid Common Mistakes

- Always register all types before creating or converting objects.
- Include a clear `type` key in dictionaries you want to convert.
- Use aliases prudently, avoid conflicts and ensure they map to existing types.
- Prefer explicit `dict_constructor` methods when complex object creation is required.
- Use lazy registration only when necessary and verify proper resolution.
- When restricting types with `allowed_cls`, be mindful of class hierarchy.

## 5. Troubleshooting Tips

<Tip>
If you encounter unexpected errors:

1. Check your factory’s registry keys and contents with `print(factory.registry)`.
2. Log dictionary inputs before conversion.
3. Test object creation with minimal arguments to isolate issues.
4. Use try-except blocks to catch exceptions and print detailed error messages.
5. Consult the `error-handling` API page for detailed error categorizations and resolutions.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Do not attempt to convert dictionaries without type information unless you have customized the Factory conversion logic to handle such cases.
</Warning>

<Info>
Keep your development environment updated and ensure you use a compatible version of Dessine-moi as some behaviors and error messages improve in recent releases.
