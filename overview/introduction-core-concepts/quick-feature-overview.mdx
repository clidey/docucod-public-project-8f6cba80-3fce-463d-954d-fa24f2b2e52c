# Key Features at a Glance

Discover Dessine-moi’s essential capabilities in transforming raw data into structured Python objects with elegance and efficiency. This concise spotlight reveals how Dessine-moi empowers developers to register types, create instances via factories, convert dictionaries seamlessly, and tailor workflows to complex needs.

## Unlocking Dessine-moi's Core Powers

Dessine-moi is designed to help you build Python object trees dynamically from nested data, such as JSON-like dictionaries. Instead of manually crafting every object, Dessine-moi uses a factory pattern approach, where you register your Python classes once and then effortlessly create instances from simple data structures.

### Why It Matters for You

Imagine receiving complex nested dictionaries from an API or configuration files. Dessine-moi lets you map those directly into usable Python objects without verbose boilerplate code. This saves time, reduces errors, and makes your codebase more maintainable and expressive.

## Essential Features Explained

### 1. Register Types to the Factory

Start by creating a factory and registering your classes (types) with unique identifiers. Registration can be explicit by specifying the type and ID or done elegantly through decorators.

- **Registering a class:** Associates a string ID with a Python class.
- **Aliases:** Multiple IDs can point to the same class, providing flexibility.
- **Lazy Registration:** You can defer importing the class until it's needed, boosting startup speed.

```python
import dessinemoi
import attrs

factory = dessinemoi.Factory()

@factory.register(type_id='sheep')
@attrs.define
class Sheep:
    wool: str = 'some'

# Registering with aliases
factory.alias('sheep', 'mouton')
```

### 2. Factory-Driven Object Creation

Once registered, the factory can create instances of your classes by specifying the type ID and optionally passing constructor arguments.

- Supports positional and keyword arguments.
- Supports specifying allowed classes to ensure type safety.
- Allows using class method constructors for specialized instantiation.

```python
merino = factory.create('sheep', kwargs={'wool': 'lots'})
print(merino)  # Sheep(wool='lots')

# Using a class method constructor
@attrs.define
class Sheep:
    wool: str

    @classmethod
    def unsheavable(cls):
        return cls(wool='none')

factory.register(Sheep, type_id='sheep', overwrite_id=True)

unsheared = factory.create('sheep', construct='unsheavable')
print(unsheared)  # Sheep(wool='none')
```

### 3. Convert Dictionaries to Objects Automatically

Dessine-moi shines in converting nested dictionaries into the right Python object trees using the factory’s `convert` method.

- The dictionary must include a `type` key indicating the type ID.
- Non-dictionary values are returned unchanged.
- Supports restricting conversions to allowed classes.
- Supports dictionary-based custom constructors.

```python
data = {'type': 'sheep', 'wool': 'soft'}
sheep_obj = factory.convert(data)
print(sheep_obj)  # Sheep(wool='soft')
```

### 4. Customize Factories for Your Needs

If the default behavior does not cover all your use cases, Dessine-moi allows subclassing the factory and overriding methods like `convert`. This flexibility lets you adapt dictionary conversion or instantiation logic as needed.

### 5. Lazy Type Registration

To avoid unnecessary imports or heavyweight dependencies, you can register types by their qualified string name. The actual class is only loaded when created.

```python
factory.register('datetime.datetime', type_id='datetime')
dt = factory.create('datetime', args=(2024, 6, 25))
print(dt)  # 2024-06-25 00:00:00
```

## How These Features Solve Your Challenges

- **Simplify Data to Objects:** Instead of manually parsing and building trees, just register types once.
- **Maintain Flexibility:** Easily extend the factory for complex workflows or new use cases.
- **Improve Performance:** Lazy registration avoids unnecessary imports until truly needed.
- **Reduce Boilerplate:** Dictionary conversion means less repetitive code when receiving JSON or config data.

You move from cumbersome, error-prone object construction to clean, declarative object creation flows.

## Getting Started Preview

Begin with instantiating a Factory and registering your first types. Then, instantiate objects directly or convert dictionaries into structured typed objects with ease.

For detailed instructions, visit the [Getting Started section](/getting-started/setup-basics/prerequisites) to set up your environment, followed by [Basic Configuration and Import](/getting-started/first-usage/basic-setup).

---

## Practical Tip

When registering classes that use custom class method constructors for dictionary conversion, map the method name as the `dict_constructor` argument to optimize your factory conversions.

```python
factory.register(Sheep, type_id='sheep', dict_constructor='unsheavable')
obj = factory.convert({'type': 'sheep'})
print(obj)  # Sheep(wool='none')
```

This way, the factory knows exactly how to convert dictionaries for that type.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

- **Error on Unregistered Types:** Always ensure the `type_id` exists in your factory’s registry.
- **Constructor Argument Mismatches:** Check your class constructors accept keyword-only arguments for dictionary conversion.
- **Lazy Type Usage Requires IDs:** Register lazy types with explicit `type_id` to avoid errors.
