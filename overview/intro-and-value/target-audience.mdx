# Who Should Use Dessine-moi?

## Unlock Dynamic Object Creation in Your Python Projects

If you are a Python developer caught in the challenge of transforming deeply nested dictionaries—such as those derived from JSON documents—into well-structured Python objects, *Dessine-moi* offers a straightforward, reliable solution. This page is designed specifically for you: developers and teams who require a flexible factory pattern implementation to meet complex object construction tasks with ease and precision.

---

## Ideal User Profiles

- **Python Developers Working with Nested Data:** Whether dealing with JSON configuration files, complex API responses, or hierarchical data structures, you need tools that can translate nested dictionaries seamlessly into Python objects.

- **Software Engineers Needing Extensible Object Creation:** If your application demands dynamic object trees with customizable construction logic, *Dessine-moi* helps you create, register, and instantiate object types flexibly.

- **Teams using `attrs` or Similar Data Class Libraries:** For those leveraging *attrs* to define immutable or mutable data classes, *Dessine-moi* integrates smoothly, enabling converters that automatically turn dicts into instances.

- **Developers Seeking Maintainable and Scalable Factories:** You want your factory pattern to evolve as your codebase grows. *Dessine-moi* supports lazy type registration, aliases, and custom subclassing.

---

## Practical Scenarios Where Dessine-moi Excels

### 1. Parsing and Instantiating Complex JSON Documents
Imagine you receive a JSON document describing components, each with nested properties and types. Instead of manually parsing and writing convoluted if-else chains, *Dessine-moi* lets you register your classes and instantiate objects dynamically simply based on dictionary content.

### 2. Building Configurable Systems with Plugin Behavior
Systems that consume configuration trees with typed components—such as rendering engines, simulation setups, or data pipelines—can register component classes once and then construct entire hierarchies from dictionaries passed at runtime.

### 3. Simplifying Factory Management in Large Codebases
As your application’s number of object types grows, managing them manually becomes error-prone. *Dessine-moi* supports aliasing and lazy registration, reducing upfront import overhead and improving code clarity.

---

## Why Dessine-moi Is Your Reliable Choice

- **Extensibility:** Easily customize factory behavior by subclassing.
- **Flexibility:** Register classes via decorators or explicit calls, with control over constructors.
- **Integration:** Designed for seamless use with *attrs* and compatible object patterns.
- **Performance:** Lazy registration defers overhead, loading types only when needed.

## Common User Intent and Needs Addressed

| User Intent | How Dessine-moi Delivers |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| Transform nested dict data into typed Python objects | Factory pattern with dict conversion and registration capabilities |
| Avoid boilerplate code for object creation from config files | Dynamic mapping of type IDs to Python classes |
| Maintain flexible, evolving object models | Aliases and lazy loading for type management |
| Integrate with attrs library for clean, immutable data structures | Built-in support for attrs-compatible conversion methods |

## Getting Started Highlights for New Users

If you are new to *Dessine-moi*, the simplest path forward is:

1. **Create a Factory:** Instantiate the `Factory` object.
2. **Register Your Types:** Use the `register` method, either as a decorator or direct call, to add your classes.
3. **Create Objects Dynamically:** Use `create` or `convert` methods to generate instances from dictionaries that specify type IDs.

For detailed workflows and examples, visit [Your First Factory: Usage Example](../getting-started/first-steps/first-factory).

---

## Tips for Success

- Define a class attribute `_TYPE_ID` on your types to streamline registration.
- Use `aliases` to support multiple type references to the same class.
- Leverage `dict_constructor` to bind special class method constructors for dictionary input.
- Utilize `allowed_cls` to enforce type safety during object creation.

<Note>
Even if you don’t use *attrs*, *Dessine-moi* can accommodate your plain Python classes, but attrs compatibility unlocks powerful converters.
</Note>

---

## What You Should Know Before Diving In

- *Dessine-moi* requires Python 3.8+.
- It depends on the *attrs* library for conversion facilities but is not restricted to it.
- Lazy registration helps reduce import overhead but disables some type introspection features.
