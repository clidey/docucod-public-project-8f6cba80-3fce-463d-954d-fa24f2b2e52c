# Key Features at a Glance

Discover the essential capabilities of Dessine-moi that empower you to transform nested dictionaries into fully instantiated Python objects with ease. This overview lets you quickly evaluate how the product fits your needs by highlighting core functionalities including type registration, object creation, seamless integration with attrs, and deep customization options.

---

## Fast Type Registration

Dessine-moi simplifies the process of registering Python classes with your factory. You can:

- Register classes directly by their Python object or via a lazy string reference to defer imports.
- Associate custom type identifiers (`type_id`) to easily reference classes for creation.
- Define multiple aliases for a single registered type, enabling flexible references.
- Register with optional dictionary constructors, such as class methods, that shape how objects are created from dictionaries.

### Example

```python
from dessinemoi import Factory
import attrs

factory = Factory()

@attrs.define
class Sheep:
    _TYPE_ID = 'sheep'
    wool: str = 'some'

factory.register(Sheep)  # Simple registration using _TYPE_ID
factory.alias('sheep', 'mouton')  # Create an alias
```


## Dynamic Object Creation from Dictionaries

Turn any dictionary conforming to your type system into a concrete Python object.

- Instantiate objects using type IDs with optional positional and keyword arguments.
- Support for restricting the kinds of types allowed for added safety.
- Ability to select class method constructors during instantiation for advanced patterns.

### Example

```python
sheep = factory.create('sheep', kwargs={'wool': 'thick'})
print(sheep)  # Output: Sheep(wool='thick')

# Using a custom constructor
@attrs.define
class Ram(Sheep):
    _TYPE_ID = 'ram'
    @classmethod
    def old(cls, name):
        return cls(wool='rough')

factory.register(Ram)
ram = factory.create('ram', construct='old')
```


## attrs-Compatible Converters

Dessine-moi offers converters compatible with the attrs library, allowing automatic conversion of nested dictionaries directly into registered objects during class instantiation.

- The `convert` method serves as a converter that recognizes dictionary inputs with a `type` key.
- Converts only those dictionaries with recognized type IDs; otherwise, returns objects unchanged.
- Can be restricted with `allowed_cls` to enforce type constraints.

### Example

```python
input_data = {'type': 'sheep', 'wool': 'soft'}
sheep_obj = factory.convert(input_data)
print(sheep_obj)  # Sheep(wool='soft')
```


## Customization and Extensibility

You control every aspect of how your factory behaves:

- Customize the factory by subclassing and overriding conversion methods for specialized behaviors.
- Support lazy registration by specifying class references as strings; imports happen only when needed.
- Control overwrite behavior for registrations with the `overwrite_id` flag to safely update existing entries.
- Extend the factory with aliases and multiple constructors to match evolving application needs.

### Example

```python
# Register a type lazily by string path
a_date_type = 'datetime.datetime'
factory.register(a_date_type, type_id='datetime')

# Object is created only when needed
dt_obj = factory.create('datetime', args=(2025, 6, 25))
print(dt_obj)  # 2025-06-25 00:00:00
```


## Why These Features Matter

Imagine you have a deeply nested JSON structure representing complex domain objects with multiple types. Dessine-moi lets you register your domain models and automatically convert that JSON into a native Python object graph without writing manually nested constructors or parsers.

This makes your codebase cleaner, reduces boilerplate, and increases development speed, especially when dealing with dynamic input where type definitions might change or grow.

---

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

- **Avoid type ID collisions:** By default, registering two classes with the same `type_id` raises an error. Use `overwrite_id=True` only if you explicitly want to replace a registration.
- **Lazy registration caution:** When using strings for lazy loading, be aware that some safety checks are postponed until object creation time, so errors surface later.
- **Dict constructors:** If your classes have alternate constructors for dictionary data, register them using the `dict_constructor` parameter to ensure correct instantiation.
- **Restrict types for safety:** Use `allowed_cls` in `create` and `convert` methods to prevent unexpected types in sensitive contexts.

## Code Snippet: Quick Feature Overview

```python
from dessinemoi import Factory
import attrs

factory = Factory()

@factory.register
@attrs.define
class Sheep:
    _TYPE_ID = 'sheep'
    wool: str = 'some'

# Creating and aliasing
factory.alias('sheep', 'mouton')

# Create object
sheep_obj = factory.create('sheep', kwargs={'wool': 'thick'})

# Convert dictionary directly
converted = factory.convert({'type': 'sheep', 'wool': 'soft'})

print(sheep_obj, converted)
```
