# What is Dessine-moi?

## A Simple, Intuitive Python Factory for Dynamic Object Creation

Imagine you have a complicated nested dictionary or JSON document and you want to quickly turn it into an actual Python object tree. This is where *Dessine-moi* shines. It provides a clean and minimalistic factory pattern implementation that dynamically creates Python objects based on dictionary data.

### Why You Should Care

- **Dynamic object creation from dictionaries:** Gone are the days of manually parsing nested data. *Dessine-moi* lets you register types upfront and then create objects on the fly simply by using dictionary definitions.
- **Seamless integration with Python types:** Whether you use plain classes or *attrs*-decorated ones, the factory works with your existing code.
- **Enhanced flexibility:** Choose from eager or lazy type registration and easily alias types for convenience.
- **Tailored for real-world needs:** Designed originally to parse complex JSON into meaningful Python objects, making your data workflows efficient.

### What is Dessine-moi?

*Dessine-moi* is a Python library that implements the factory design pattern with a focus on dynamic creation of objects based on dictionary inputs. Instead of hardcoding class instantiations, it lets you define a factory once, register your types, and then create instances from dicts anytime, anywhere.

#### Core Philosophy

The guiding principle of *Dessine-moi* is simplicity combined with powerful flexibility.

- **Simple:** Minimal ceremony to register types and produce instances.
- **Intuitive:** Dictionary keys map naturally to constructor arguments.
- **Dynamic:** Supports lazy imports to defer heavy dependencies until needed.

With this approach, it solves a common problem seen in applications dealing with external JSON or config-based data sources that define object structures.

### How Dessine-moi Works at a High Level

- You create a **Factory** object to act as a registry for Python types.
- You **register** Python classes with the factory, associating them with string identifiers.
- Once registered, you can **create** instances by type ID, passing constructor arguments.
- You can convert dictionaries containing a `type` key into the appropriate Python objects.
- Support for lazy registration means you can register a type by its fully qualified name (as a string), delaying import until instantiation.

### Key Value Propositions

- **Rapid object instantiation:** Instantiate complex object hierarchies with minimal code.
- **Dictionary-driven workflows:** Perfect for JSON deserialization and config-based systems.
- **Flexible registration:** Decorator and method-based registration with aliases.
- **Supports advanced construction:** Call class method constructors transparently.
- **Lazy import support:** Reduce startup overhead by deferring type imports.

### Example Scenario

Suppose you receive a JSON payload describing animals on a farm, with different species and attributes. Instead of writing custom parsing for each species, you define a few Python classes (`Sheep`, `Ram`, `Lamb`), register them with your factory, and then call `convert()` passing the JSON.

This converts the nested dictionary automatically into a rich set of Python objects ready for further processing, analytics, or operations.

### Summary

*Dessine-moi* offers a pragmatic and elegant way to build Python objects dynamically from dictionaries, turning opaque data into actionable code structures with a few lines. It is ideal for projects needing lightweight but powerful dynamic object creation, especially those working with JSON or similar data sources.

## Practical Tips for Getting Started

- Begin by instantiating a `Factory`.
- Register your classes, ideally using the decorator syntax.
- Use `.create()` to instantiate objects by their IDs with arguments.
- Convert dictionaries with `.convert()`, providing a `type` key.
- Utilize aliases to handle synonymous type identifiers.
- Consider lazy registration to defer imports of heavy dependencies.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Forgetting to register a type before creating or converting raises errors.
- Using dictionary entries without a `type` key will not trigger conversion.
- Overwriting type IDs without explicit permission (`overwrite_id=True`) is disallowed.
- Lazy type strings must be fully qualified module paths.
