# Integration with the Python Ecosystem

Explore how Dessine-moi seamlessly integrates with popular Python idioms, empowering you to convert raw JSON or dictionary data into rich, typed Python objects with ease. This page focuses specifically on leveraging Dessine-moi alongside the `attrs` library (a modern alternative to dataclasses), managing standard Python data types like `dict` and JSON, and customizing behavior to fit diverse Python workflows.

---

## Why Dessine-moi Fits Naturally in Python Workflows

Dessine-moi is designed to slot into Python projects where you process structured data — especially nested dictionaries or JSON — and want to automatically create well-typed, immutable Python objects.

Many Python developers today prefer `attrs` for defining their data structures due to its simplicity and flexibility. Dessine-moi complements this choice by serving as a "factory" that can automatically instantiate these `attrs` classes from raw data, removing manual boilerplate.

### What You Gain

- **Smooth Integration with `attrs` Classes:** Register your `attrs` classes with Dessine-moi's factory to create instances from raw dicts effortlessly.
- **Flexible Handling of JSON or Dict Data:** Convert incoming JSON or Python dictionaries into rich Python object trees transparently.
- **Extensible and Customizable:** Optionally specify custom dictionary constructors or converters for specialized workflows.

## Integrating with attrs: An Idiomatic Partnership

`attrs` is a widely used Python library for defining classes with automatically generated special methods like `__init__` and `__repr__`. Dessine-moi works hand-in-hand with `attrs`:

- Register any `attrs` class with the factory to enable automated object construction.
- Leverage `attrs.frozen` or `attrs.define` classes for immutable or mutable objects.
- Use Dessine-moi's `convert` method to translate dict data directly into these classes.

### Example: Registering and Using an attrs Class

```python
import attrs
import dessinemoi

@dessinemoi.register
@attrs.frozen
class Sheep:
    _TYPE_ID = "sheep"
    age: int = attrs.field()
    name: str = attrs.field()

# Create an instance from positional args
sheep = dessinemoi.create("sheep", args=(5, "Dolly"))
print(sheep)  # Sheep(age=5, name='Dolly')

# Convert from dict data
data = {"type": "sheep", "age": 7, "name": "Molly"}
sheep2 = dessinemoi.convert(data)
print(sheep2)  # Sheep(age=7, name='Molly')
```

### Custom Dict Constructors

Sometimes your `attrs` classes may require special initialization beyond simply passing keyword arguments. Dessine-moi supports specifying a custom classmethod to handle dictionary-based construction.

```python
@attrs.define
class Sheep:
    wool: str

    @classmethod
    def merino(cls):
        return cls(wool="lots")

factory.register(Sheep, type_id="sheep", dict_constructor="merino")

sheep = dessinemoi.convert({"type": "sheep"})
print(sheep)  # Sheep(wool='lots')
```

This approach lets you seamlessly incorporate richer factory logic without losing the convenience of automatic conversion.

## Working with JSON and Dict Data

At its core, Dessine-moi is optimized to transform structured JSON or nested Python dictionaries into typed Python objects defined with `attrs` or compatible classes.

### User Flow: Typical Data Conversion

1. **Receive JSON or dict:** For example, loading JSON from a REST API response or config file.
2. **Pass to `factory.convert()`:** Dessine-moi accepts the dict and detects the `type` key.
3. **Automatic type resolution:** Dispatches to the appropriate class factory method based on the registered type ID.
4. **Object creation:** Produces fully typed Python instances, including nested objects.

### Why This Matters

- Removes tedious manual parsing and instantiation code.
- Ensures your application works with fully typed and validated objects.
- Supports nested and polymorphic data gracefully.

## Extension and Customization Paths

Dessine-moi is flexible enough to adapt beyond simple `attrs` integration and dict-to-object conversion:

- **Lazy Type Loading:** Use `LazyType` to defer imports of heavy or optional class modules until instantiation time — ideal for managing large projects or plugins.
- **Type Aliasing:** Register multiple type IDs mapping to the same class for backward compatibility or domain-specific naming.
- **Overwrite and Decorator Options:** Customize registration behavior to handle complex type hierarchies.

### Example: Lazy Type Registration

```python
from dessinemoi import LazyType

lazy_class = LazyType("my_module.submodule", "MyClass")
factory.register(lazy_class, type_id="myclass")
my_instance = factory.create("myclass")  # Loads MyClass dynamically
```

## Best Practices and Tips

- Always define `_TYPE_ID` as a unique identifier for your classes.
- Register all types upfront, typically when your application initializes.
- Use `convert()` when processing external JSON or dict data to ensure type safety.
- Leverage custom dict constructors sparingly for complex initializations.
- Employ lazy loading to reduce startup time for large codebases.

## Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with attrs and Data Conversion">
<Accordion title="Type Not Registered Error">
You must register your classes with the factory before creating or converting them. Forgetting registration results in a `ValueError` stating the type is unknown.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Incorrect Dict Constructor Name">
If specifying a custom dict constructor, ensure the classmethod exists and is correctly named; otherwise, registration will raise a `ValueError`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Conflicts on Type IDs or Aliases">
Attempting to register or alias a type ID already in use without explicit `overwrite_id=True` will raise errors. Plan your type IDs carefully.
