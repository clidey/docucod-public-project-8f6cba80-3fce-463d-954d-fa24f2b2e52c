# Prerequisites and System Requirements

Before installing and using *Dessine-moi*, ensure your system matches the following requirements and dependencies. Verifying your environment upfront saves you time and prevents common setup pitfalls.

---

## 1. Supported Python Versions

*Dessine-moi* requires Python **3.8** or higher. It is fully compatible with the latest stable Python releases, including:

- Python 3.8
- Python 3.9
- Python 3.10
- Python 3.11
- Python 3.12
- Python 3.13

Using older Python versions will lead to incompatibility errors during installation or runtime.

<Tip>
Always use an up-to-date Python environment. If you manage multiple versions, consider using `pyenv` or virtual environments to isolate installations.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Required Dependencies

*Dessine-moi* depends on the following external Python package:

- [`attrs`](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/): Provides class decorators and methods to simplify class creation and attribute management.

This dependency is automatically installed alongside *Dessine-moi* when using `pip` or Conda.

<Tip>
If you manually manage packages or have custom environment restrictions, ensure `attrs` is installed before attempting to install *Dessine-moi*:

```bash
pip install attrs
```
</Tip>

---

## 3. Recommended Setup Tools

For a smooth installation and maintenance experience, the following tools are highly recommended:

- **Python virtual environments:** Use `venv`, `virtualenv`, or Conda environments to avoid polluting your global Python packages and ensure consistent dependency resolution.
- **Package managers:**
  - `pip` (Python's official package manager)
  - `conda` (for users who prefer Conda environments and packages)

These tools help manage dependencies cleanly and isolate projects.

---

## 4. Verifying Your Environment Compatibility

Before proceeding with installation, perform these quick checks.

### Step 1: Check Python version

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see output like:

```
Python 3.9.7
```

If your Python version is below 3.8, upgrade before continuing.

### Step 2: Verify `attrs` installation

In a Python interpreter session, run:

```python
import attr
print(attr.__version__)
```

If you get an error, install attrs using:

```bash
pip install attrs
```

<Tip>
If you see any import errors or version mismatches, resolve them before progressing with *Dessine-moi*.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Network and Firewall Considerations

Both `pip` and Conda require internet access to fetch packages. Ensure your environment allows outbound connections on the following domains and ports:

- PyPI repository: `pypi.org` (port 443)
- Conda-forge channel: `conda.anaconda.org` or `anaconda.org` (port 443)

If you are behind a corporate firewall or proxy, configure your package manager accordingly.

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Using an unsupported Python version:** Installation will fail silently or with confusing errors.
- **Global Python installations without virtual environments:** Can cause package conflicts.
- **Poor network connectivity or firewall blocks:** Interrupt package downloads.
- **Skipping `attrs` installation in custom setups:** This leads to import errors at runtime.

Being mindful of these points saves troubleshooting time.

---

## 6. Summary Checklist

- [ ] Python 3.8 or higher installed
- [ ] `attrs` dependency installed
- [ ] Using virtual environment or isolated setup
- [ ] Network access for package downloads enabled

For detailed installation instructions, proceed to the next guide: [Installing Dessine-moi](/getting-started/setup/installation).

For a comprehensive overview of required dependencies, see the project [README](https://github.com/rayference/dessinemoi#readme).

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Tips

If you encounter issues:

- Confirm Python version with `python --version`.
- Check if `attrs` is importable in your Python shell.
- Recreate your virtual environment if dependency conflicts appear.
- Use verbose pip output to diagnose installation errors:

```bash
pip install dessinemoi --verbose
```

- Consult the [Troubleshooting and Common Issues](/getting-started/first-steps/troubleshooting) page for known problems.
