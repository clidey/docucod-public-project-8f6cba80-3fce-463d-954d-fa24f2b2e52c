# Configuration and Setup

Welcome to the **Configuration and Setup** guide for *Dessine-moi*. This page walks you through essential steps to set up your environment after installation. You'll learn how to import *Dessine-moi*, initialize your factory, and verify your installation version. Additionally, we highlight optional advanced configurations for tailoring the factory to your needs through linking to key API entry points.

---

## 1. Importing Dessine-moi

Before using *Dessine-moi*, ensure that it is properly imported into your Python environment.

```python
import dessinemoi
```

Once imported, the module exposes a default factory instance and utility functions to begin registering types and creating objects dynamically.


## 2. Initializing Your Factory

At the core of *Dessine-moi* lies the `Factory` class, which manages your mapping between string type IDs and Python classes. You need to instantiate this factory before registering types or creating objects.

```python
factory = dessinemoi.Factory()
```

This factory starts with an empty registry. Your typical next step is to register one or more Python types (classes) under string identifiers.

### Registering Types

Register your Python classes to the factory using:

```python
factory.register(YourClass, type_id="your_type_id")
```

Or use the `@factory.register` decorator syntax on your classes for clean, readable code.

Refer to the [Your First Factory: Usage Example](../getting-started/first-steps/first-factory) page for detailed guidance on type registration and usage.

## 3. Ensuring Version Correctness

Confirming your *Dessine-moi* version guarantees compatibility and eases troubleshooting.

Access the package version via:

```python
print(dessinemoi.__version__)
```

You can also access it through your factory instance:

```python
print(factory.release)  # or factory.version
```

This echoes the version installed in your environment, helping you verify updates or match documentation.

## 4. Optional Advanced Configuration

While *Dessine-moi* works out-of-the-box after basic setup, advanced users might want to customize.

- **Factory Subclassing:** Create custom factories by subclassing `Factory` and overriding methods such as `convert` for specialized dictionary conversion logics.
- **Aliases:** Assign multiple type IDs to the same class to handle different naming conventions seamlessly.
- **Lazy Registration:** Register types by string qualified names to defer imports and speed initial loading.

Explore customization options and API endpoints in the following key references:

- [`Factory` Class API](../../api-reference/factory-core-api/factory-class)
- [Type Registration and Mapping](../../api-reference/factory-core-api/type-registration)
- [Attrs-Compatible Converters](../../api-reference/advanced-and-integration/attrs-converters)
- [Customizing the Factory Behavior](../../api-reference/advanced-and-integration/custom-factory-behaviors)

## 5. Verification and Troubleshooting Tips

After configuration, perform a quick check:

```python
assert isinstance(factory, dessinemoi.Factory)
print(f'Version: {dessinemoi.__version__}')
```

If the import or factory initialization fails:

- Confirm *Dessine-moi* is installed in your current environment (`pip list | grep dessinemoi`).
- Verify you are running Python 3.8 or higher.
- Ensure that dependencies like `attrs` are properly installed.

Consult the [Troubleshooting and Common Issues](../getting-started/first-steps/troubleshooting) page for additional help.

## Summary

You are now ready to proceed confidently with *Dessine-moi*. Begin by importing and initializing your factory. Register your types, confirm your versions, and optionally explore advanced customization to tailor the factory precisely to your needs.

For practical examples and next steps, navigate to your first usage guides and detailed API references.
