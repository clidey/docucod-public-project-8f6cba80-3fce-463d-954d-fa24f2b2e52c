# Installing Dessine-moi

This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions to install *Dessine-moi*, a Python factory library for dynamic object creation. Whether you prefer using pip or conda, this page explains both methods with platform-specific tips and best practices to ensure a clean, error-free installation.

---

## 1. Prepare Your Environment

Before installing, ensure your environment meets the prerequisites:

- **Python Version:** 3.8 or higher
- **Recommended:** Use a virtual environment to isolate Dessine-moi and its dependencies

### Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but strongly recommended)

```bash
# On Unix or macOS
python3 -m venv dessinemoi-env
source dessinemoi-env/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv dessinemoi-env
dessinemoi-env\Scripts\activate
```

Using a virtual environment prevents conflicts with other Python packages on your system and is the best practice for Python project management.

<Tip>
If you’re new to virtual environments, they are lightweight sandboxes that keep your project dependencies separate, avoiding version clashes and permission issues.
</Tip>

## 2. Installing with pip

*pip* is the standard Python package installer and the recommended way to install *Dessine-moi*.

### Step-by-step pip installation:

<Steps>
<Step title="Upgrade pip">
Ensure your pip is up to date to avoid installation errors:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```
</Step>
<Step title="Install Dessine-moi">
Run this command to install the latest stable version from PyPI:

```bash
pip install dessinemoi
```
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Installation">
Confirm the package installed correctly:

```bash
python -c "import dessinemoi; print(dessinemoi.__version__)"
```

You should see the version number printed without errors.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If you encounter permission errors, avoid using `sudo pip install`. Instead, ensure your virtual environment is activated or use the `--user` flag for a user-local installation.
</Note>

## 3. Installing with conda

If you use the Conda package manager, *Dessine-moi* is available on the conda-forge channel.

### Step-by-step conda installation:

<Steps>
<Step title="Add conda-forge channel">
First, make sure the conda-forge channel is enabled:

```bash
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```
</Step>
<Step title="Create a conda environment (optional)">
Isolate your setup by creating a new conda environment for Dessine-moi:

```bash
conda create -n dessinemoi-env python=3.10
conda activate dessinemoi-env
```
</Step>
<Step title="Install Dessine-moi">
Run this command to install Dessine-moi:

```bash
conda install dessinemoi
```
</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Verify the installation by opening Python and importing:

```python
import dessinemoi
print(dessinemoi.__version__)
```

If the version prints without error, installation is successful.
</Check>

## 4. Best Practices and Tips

- **Start fresh:** When testing Dessine-moi, a clean environment avoids package conflicts.
- **Check Python version:** Running `python --version` helps confirm Python 3.8+ before installation.
- **Use virtual environments:** This is the safest approach for dependency management.
- **Keep tools updated:** Regularly update pip (`pip install --upgrade pip`) or conda to minimize issues.

<Tip>
If you install Dessine-moi globally and run into permission issues, consider switching to a virtual environment or user-local installs.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues & Solutions">
<Accordion title="Permission Errors with pip">
Try installing with the `--user` flag or use a virtual environment:

```bash
pip install --user dessinemoi
```

Alternatively, create a virtual environment to isolate your setup.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Python Version Not Supported">
Ensure you are running Python 3.8 or above:

```bash
python --version
```

Install a supported Python version if necessary.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Conda Package Not Found">
Make sure the `conda-forge` channel is enabled and prioritized:

```bash
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

Then retry installation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Virtual Environment Activation Issues">
On Windows PowerShell, you might need to change the execution policy:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Remember to activate your environment each new shell session.
