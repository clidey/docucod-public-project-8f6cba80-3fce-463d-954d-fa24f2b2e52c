# Basic Configuration and Import

Welcome to your first step in using *Dessine-moi*, a Python factory library designed to simplify creating Python objects dynamically from nested dictionaries. This guide walks you through importing the package, understanding the core Factory object, and completing the one-time setup required to begin working with Dessine-moi’s core features.

---

## 1. Installing Dessine-moi (Prerequisite)
If you haven't installed Dessine-moi yet, please refer to the [Installation Instructions](https://dessinemoi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/setup-basics/installation.html). Use `pip` or Conda in a Python 3.8+ environment:

```bash
python -m pip install dessinemoi
# or
conda install -c conda-forge dessinemoi
```

<Tip>
Use a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies and avoid package conflicts.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Importing Dessine-moi

Start by importing the main package and leveraging its built-in default factory instance.

```python
import dessinemoi

# Access the default Factory instance
factory = dessinemoi.factory
print(factory)  # Should confirm an empty registry
```

The `factory` object is your gateway to registering types, creating instances, and converting dictionaries into typed objects.

---

## 3. Understanding the Factory Object

`Factory` is the core class managing:

- A **registry** mapping string type IDs to Python classes
- Methods to register types, create instances, and convert dictionary data

You can create your own `Factory` instance if you prefer isolation or advanced setups:

```python
from dessinemoi import Factory

custom_factory = Factory()
```

But the default `factory` instance is fully functional for most use cases.

---

## 4. One-Time Configuration: Registering Types

Before creating objects, you must register the Python classes you want the factory to instantiate.

### Registering a Class
Use `factory.register()` either as a method or a decorator.

```python
import attrs

@factory.register
@attrs.define
class Sheep:
    _TYPE_ID = 'sheep'
    wool: str = 'some'
```

- The class must declare a unique `_TYPE_ID` attribute to serve as its registry key unless you explicitly provide `type_id`.

- Registering binds the class inside the factory's registry, enabling creation and conversion.

<Tip>
Registering using the decorator syntax is the cleanest way and ensures the class is immediately ready for the factory.
</Tip>

### Registering with Explicit `type_id`
```python
@factory.register(type_id='lamb')
@attrs.define
class Lamb:
    wool: str = 'soft'
```

### Aliases
You can also assign additional aliases for a type during registration:

```python
factory.register(Sheep, type_id='sheep', aliases=['mouton', 'oveja'])
```

This way, multiple keys instantiate the same class.

---

## 5. No Other One-Time Config Needed
At this stage, Dessine-moi requires no further one-time setup:

- The factory is ready.
- Types are registered.
- You can proceed to create instances or convert dictionary data.

This minimal initial configuration reduces barriers to productivity.

---

## 6. Best Practices and Tips

- **Use `attrs` for your classes**: While not mandatory, `attrs` provides immutable and type-friendly Python classes that integrate smoothly.
- **Keep `_TYPE_ID` unique**: Duplicate keys cause registration errors unless you explicitly allow overwrites.
- **Register before creating**: Types must be registered before you call `factory.create` or `factory.convert`.
- **Utilize aliases thoughtfully**: Aliases simplify multi-language or legacy key support but track them carefully.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Basic Configuration">
<Accordion title="Factory object not found or AttributeError on import">
Make sure you have Dessine-moi installed in your current Python environment.

Run:

```bash
python -m pip show dessinemoi
```

If not installed, install it as instructed above.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Registering a class without `_TYPE_ID` and no `type_id` argument">
Dessine-moi requires a type identifier to register a class. Provide either the class attribute `_TYPE_ID` or pass `type_id` explicitly during registration.

```python
factory.register(MyClass, type_id='myclass')
```

Or add `_TYPE_ID = 'myclass'` to the class.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Duplicate type identifier error on registration">
Avoid registering two different classes with the same type ID without setting `overwrite_id=True`. This prevents accidental overrides.

If intentional, specify:

```python
factory.register(OtherClass, type_id='myclass', overwrite_id=True)
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Next Steps

With the factory configured and your first types registered, you are ready to:

- [Create your first object tree using your registered types](https://dessinemoi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/first-usage/first-object-tree.html).
- Explore dictionary-to-object conversion with [`factory.convert()`](https://dessinemoi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/getting-started/dict-to-object.html).
- Learn how to register complex types and handle lazy registration.

## Summary
This page has walked you through importing Dessine-moi, exploring the main Factory object, and performing the essential one-time configuration by registering your first types. You now have a factory ready to create rich Python objects from simple dictionaries.
