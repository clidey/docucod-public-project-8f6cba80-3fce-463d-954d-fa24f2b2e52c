# Quick Validation Steps

Ensure your Dessine-moi installation is successful and ready to use by running a few simple commands. These quick checks validate that the package is installed correctly, can be imported in Python, and confirms the active version.

---

## 1. Open Your Python Environment

Start your preferred Python environment â€” this can be a terminal-based Python shell, IPython, a notebook, or any Python interactive console where you can run commands.

```bash
python
```


## 2. Import Dessine-moi Package

Run the following command to import the main Dessine-moi module.

```python
import dessinemoi
```

If this step completes without errors, Dessine-moi is installed and accessible in your current Python environment.

<Check>
If you see an `ImportError` or `ModuleNotFoundError`, ensure you have installed Dessine-moi correctly, possibly using a virtual environment. Refer to the Installation Instructions guide for help.
</Check>


## 3. Verify Dessine-moi Version

Print the version string to confirm which version of Dessine-moi is installed.

```python
print(dessinemoi.__version__)
```

This should output a version number in the format `major.minor.patch`, for example, `25.1.0`.


## 4. Confirm Default Factory Initialization

Check that the default factory instance is available and ready.

```python
print(dessinemoi.factory)
```

This will display a `Factory` object with its registry (which should be empty initially).

Once these steps succeed, you are guaranteed that Dessine-moi is installed and the core factory system is ready for use. You can now proceed to configure your first factory and register your types.
