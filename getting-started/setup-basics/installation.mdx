# Installation Instructions

This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions to install **Dessine-moi** using the most common Python package managers: PyPI (pip) and Conda. You will also learn how to upgrade an existing installation, verify your installation success, and troubleshoot common issues across major operating systems.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Python Version:** 3.8 or later is required.
- **Dependencies:** The primary dependency, `attrs`, will be installed automatically with Dessine-moi.
- **Supported Platforms:** Installation supports Windows, macOS, and Linux.

<Tip>
Verify your Python version beforehand by running:

```bash
python --version
```
Ensure it returns Python 3.8 or newer.
</Tip>

## 2. Installation Methods

### 2.1 Installing via PyPI (pip)

This is the recommended and most flexible method.

#### Steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Activate your Python environment">
If you use virtual environments (highly recommended), activate it first. For example, using `venv` on Linux/macOS:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

On Windows:

```powershell
python -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

If you don't use virtual environments, proceed with your system Python.
</Step>
<Step title="Install Dessine-moi">
Run the following command to install the latest stable version from PyPI:

```bash
pip install dessinemoi
```

This command will also install the required `attrs` library.
</Step>
</Steps>

### 2.2 Installing via Conda

If you use the Conda ecosystem, you can install Dessine-moi from the conda-forge channel.

#### Steps:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge dessinemoi
```

This ensures Dessine-moi and its dependencies are installed in your Conda environment.

## 3. Upgrading Dessine-moi

To update Dessine-moi to the latest version:

- Using pip:

```bash
pip install --upgrade dessinemoi
```

- Using Conda:

```bash
conda update -c conda-forge dessinemoi
```

---

## 4. Verifying Installation

Confirm Dessine-moi was installed correctly by checking its version:

```bash
python -c "import dessinemoi; print(dessinemoi.__version__)"
```

You should see the current version number printed without errors.

<Tip>
Another quick test is to import and instantiate a factory in Python:

```python
import dessinemoi
factory = dessinemoi.Factory()
print(factory)
```

If this runs without error, your installation is working.
</Tip>

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

### 5.1 pip Not Found or Wrong Python Version

- Ensure that you are using the `pip` corresponding to Python 3.8+.
- Run `python -m pip install dessinemoi` instead of `pip install` to be explicit.

### 5.2 Permission Denied or Access Errors

- Use a virtual environment to avoid system-wide permission issues.
- On Unix-like systems, avoid using `sudo pip install` unless absolutely necessary.

### 5.3 Conda Package Not Found

- Make sure the conda-forge channel is added:

```bash
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

- Update Conda to the latest version:

```bash
conda update conda
```

### 5.4 Conflicts With Other Packages

- Try reinstalling in a clean virtual environment or Conda environment.

### 5.5 Network Connectivity or Firewall Issues

- Ensure your system can reach PyPI or Conda servers.
- Bypass corporate firewalls or configure your proxy settings if necessary.

<Warning>
If installation fails repeatedly, please check your Python packaging environment first or consult the Python packaging documentation.
</Warning>

---

## 6. Additional Tips and Best Practices

- Always prefer isolated environments (virtualenv or Conda) to manage dependencies cleanly.
- Keep your packaging tools (`pip`, `setuptools`, `wheel`) up to date:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

- Check the official [Dessine-moi PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/dessinemoi) or [conda-forge package page](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/dessinemoi) for the latest release info.

## 7. Next Steps

- After installation, proceed to configure your first factory by visiting the [Basic Configuration and Import guide](/getting-started/first-usage/basic-setup).
- Refer to [Quick Validation Steps](/getting-started/setup-basics/validation) to confirm your setup.
- Dive deeper into usage in the [Getting Started with Dessine-moi guides](/guides/getting-started/factory-basics).
