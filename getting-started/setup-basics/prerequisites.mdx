# Prerequisites and System Requirements

Preparing your development environment for *Dessine-moi* ensures a smooth installation and optimal usage experience. This page outlines the essential software versions, supported platforms, and dependencies you must have before proceeding.

---

## 1. Supported Python Versions

*Dessine-moi* requires **Python 3.8 or higher**. It has been tested and is compatible up to Python 3.13, with ongoing support for the latest Python releases to leverage modern language features.

### How to Check Your Python Version

Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
python --version
```

This should output something like:

```plaintext
Python 3.8.10
```

If your version is below 3.8, please update Python before continuing.

<Note>
Python 3.7 and earlier are not supported and may cause installation errors or runtime failures.
</Note>

---

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

*Dessine-moi* is platform-independent and runs on all major operating systems with Python 3.8+ installed:

- **Windows 10 and later**
- **macOS 10.15 (Catalina) and later**
- **Linux distributions** (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian)

<Info>
Ensure your OS has Python installed correctly and environment variables set for easy access to the python interpreter.
</Info>

---

## 3. Required Dependencies

### Primary Dependency: attrs Library

*Dessine-moi* relies on [`attrs`](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/) â€” a powerful Python package for concise class definitions and automatic attribute management.

### Installation

This package will be installed automatically when you install *Dessine-moi* via pip or conda.

Manually, you can install it by running:

```bash
python -m pip install attrs
```

or with conda:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge attrs
```

<Check>
You can verify installation by running the following in Python:

```python
import attrs
print(attrs.__version__)
```

If no error occurs and a version string appears, `attrs` is installed correctly.
</Check>

---

## 4. Optional Tools for Development

If you plan to contribute or develop *Dessine-moi* itself, consider installing the following:

- **`uv` Package Manager**: Used for managing tasks and dependencies.
- **`pre-commit` Git Hook Manager**: Helps maintain code quality by running scripts before commits.

These can be installed using:

```bash
python -m pip install uv pre-commit
```

Activate pre-commit hooks in your repository:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

<Info>
These tools are not required for using *Dessine-moi* but are important for development workflows.
</Info>

---

## 5. Network and Access Requirements

Since *Dessine-moi* is a Python library installed locally, it does not require network access after installation.

However, you will need internet access during installation to fetch packages from PyPI or conda-forge repositories.

<Warning>
If you work behind a corporate proxy or firewall, ensure your package manager (pip or conda) is properly configured to access external repositories.
</Warning>

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Problems and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Python Version Issues">
- **Problem:** `python --version` shows version less than 3.8.
- **Solution:** Download and install the latest Python from the official website https://python.org or use your OS package manager.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Dependency Installation Fails">
- **Problem:** `pip install attrs` fails due to network or permission errors.
- **Solution:** 
  - Check network connectivity.
  - Use `pip install --user attrs` to install locally if permission denied.
  - Configure proxy settings if behind a firewall.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Environment Conflicts">
- **Problem:** Multiple Python versions cause confusion.
- **Solution:** Use virtual environments (`venv` or `conda env`) to isolate project dependencies and ensure correct Python interpreter usage.
</Accordion>
